Getting support
===============

Please refer to our documentation before asking questions:

http://django-wiki.readthedocs.io/

* **DO NOT USE GITHUB FOR SUPPORT INQUIRIES!**
* **DO NOT EMAIL DEVELOPERS ASKING FOR SUPPORT!**

Django-wiki is community based. If you want support, then consider offering support to others. For instance, if you join IRC, then stay around and help others.

Please use your preferred support channels for getting answers to your questions.

* `StackOverflow tag:django-wiki <https://stackoverflow.com/tags/django-wiki>`__
* ``#django-wiki`` on irc.freenode.net
* `django-wiki@googlegroups.com <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-wiki>`__
