Running the test project
========================

In order to quickly get setup, there is a project in the git repository.

The folder **testproject/** contains a pre-configured django project and
an sqlite database. Login for django admin is ``admin:admin``. This
project should always be maintained, but please do not commit changes to
the SQLite database as we only care about its contents in case data
models are changed.
